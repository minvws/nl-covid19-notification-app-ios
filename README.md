# Covid19 Notification App - iOS

![build macOS-10.15](https://github.com/minvws/nl-covid19-notification-app-ios/workflows/build%20macOS-10.15/badge.svg)

This repository contains the iOS App of the Proof of Concept for the Dutch exposure notification app. We provide this code in an early stage so that everyone can follow along as we develop the app, and to solicit feedback. Note that due to the early stage in which we are sharing this code, significant portions of the code might still change. We might add or remove features and code as needed, based on validation and user tests that are conducted partially in parallel to the development.

* The iOS app is located in the repository you are currently viewing.
* The Android app can be found here: https://github.com/minvws/nl-covid19-notification-app-android
* The backend can be found here: https://github.com/minvws/nl-covid19-notification-app-backend
* The designs that are used as a basis to develop the apps can be found here: https://github.com/minvws/nl-covid19-notification-app-design
* The architecture that underpins the development can be found here: https://github.com/minvws/nl-covid19-notification-app-coordination

## Development & Contribution process

The core team works on the repository in a private fork (for reasons of compliance with existing processes) and will share its work as often as possible.
If you plan to make non-trivial changes, we recommend to open an issue beforehand where we can discuss your planned changes.
This increases the chance that we might be able to use your contribution (or it avoids doing work if there are reasons why we wouldn't be able to use it).

## Getting Started

Run `make dev` && `make project` to get started. Homebrew (https://brew.sh) is a requirement to install dependencies.

## Continuous Integration & reproducible builds

In order to facilitate CI and reproducible builds (https://github.com/minvws/nl-covid19-notification-app-coordination/issues/6) this codebase can be build using Github Actions.

## OpenSSL

Tihs project relies on OpenSSL to validate the KeySet signatures. OpenSSL binaries (v1.1.1d) are included and can be built using `make build_openssl`. By default the compiled binaries are part of the repo to reduce CI build times. Feel free to compile the binaries yourself.

## Disclaimer

Keep in mind that the Apple Exposure Notification API is only accessible by verified health authorities. Other devices trying to access the API using the code in this repository will fail to do so.
